This package demonstrates the PRIMARY benefit of DI: testability.
It shows how to write unit tests using mocks injected via DI.

Key concepts:
    - Unit testing with pytest
    - Mocking dependencies with unittest.mock
    - Isolating components under test
    - Testing without real external services

Modules:
    main: Implementation with testable components.
    test_main: pytest tests demonstrating DI benefits.

Run tests:
    pytest example_03/test_main.py -v
