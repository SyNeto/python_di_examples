"""
Example 01: Fundamentals of Dependency Coupling and Decoupling.

This package contains two files that demonstrate the journey from
tightly coupled code to properly decoupled code ready for DI:

Modules:
    main_before: Anti-pattern showing tightly coupled dependencies.
    main_di: Refactored code with manual dependency injection.

The progression teaches:
    1. Identify coupling problems (main_before.py)
    2. Apply DI principles manually (main_di.py)
    3. Understand WHY DI matters before using frameworks
