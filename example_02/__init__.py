"""
Example 02: Dependency Injection with a Framework.

This package demonstrates how to use the dependency-injector framework
to manage dependencies automatically, solving the limitations of
manual assembly shown in example_01.

Key concepts:
    - Container: Centralizes dependency configuration.
    - Providers: Define how dependencies are created (Singleton, Factory).
    - Wiring: Connects the container to your application code.
    - Override: Replace dependencies for testing.

Modules:
    main: Complete implementation with DI container.
